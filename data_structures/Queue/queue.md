# Definition:
A queue is a linear data structure that is open at both ends and the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order.

We define a queue to be a list in which all additions to the list are made at one end, and all deletions from the list are made at the other end.  The element which is first pushed into the order, the delete operation is first performed on that.

# FIFO Principle of Queue:
A Queue is like a line waiting to purchase tickets, where the first person in line is the first person served. (i.e. First come first serve).

Position of the entry in a queue ready to be served, that is, the first entry that will be removed from the queue, is called the front of the queue(somtimes, head of the queue), similarly, the position of the last entry in the queue, that is, the one most recently added, is called the rear (or the tail) of the queue.

# Application:
Application of queue is common. In a computer system, there may be queues of tasks waiting for the printer, for access to disk storage, or even in a time-sharing system, for use of the CPU. Within a single program, there may be multiple requests to be kept in a queue, or one task may create other tasks, which must be done in turn by keeping them in a queue.

- It has a single resource and multiple consumers.
- It synchronizes between slow and fast devices.
- In a network, a queue is used in devices such as a router/switch and mail queue.
- Variations: dequeue, priority queue and double-ended priority queue.
