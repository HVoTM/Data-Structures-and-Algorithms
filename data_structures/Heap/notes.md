# Heaps
*Definition*: A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.

# Operations:
- Heapify: a process of creating a heap from an array.
- Insertion: process to insert an element in existing heap time complexity O(log N).
- Deletion: deleting the top element of the heap or the highest priority element, and then organizing the heap and returning the element with time complexity O(log N).
- Peek: to check or find the first (or can say the top) element of the heap.

# Types:
1. Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
2. Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
