The provided code snippet transposes a matrix (2D list) in Python. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:

---

### Code:
```python
transposed_grid = [list(column) for column in zip(*grid)]
```

---

### 1. **Understand the Input (`grid`)**  
The `grid` represents a 2D list or matrix. For example:

```python
grid = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
```

This is a 3x3 matrix with rows:
- `[1, 2, 3]`
- `[4, 5, 6]`
- `[7, 8, 9]`

---

### 2. **Unpack `grid` with `*` Operator**
The `*` operator unpacks the rows of the `grid` matrix into separate arguments for the `zip()` function.

```python
zip(*grid)
```

This is equivalent to:
```python
zip([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9])
```

---

### 3. **Apply `zip()`**
The `zip()` function groups elements from the provided iterables (in this case, the rows of the matrix) into tuples. Each tuple corresponds to a column in the original matrix.

For the example above:
```python
zip([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9])
```

Produces:
```python
(1, 4, 7),  # First column of the original matrix
(2, 5, 8),  # Second column of the original matrix
(3, 6, 9)   # Third column of the original matrix
```

---

### 4. **List Comprehension**
The list comprehension iterates over each tuple produced by `zip()` and converts it into a list.

```python
[list(column) for column in zip(*grid)]
```

For each `column` (e.g., `(1, 4, 7)`), `list(column)` converts it into a list `[1, 4, 7]`.

---

### 5. **Result**
The result is a new list of lists, where each inner list is a column from the original matrix. For the example input:

```python
transposed_grid = [
    [1, 4, 7],
    [2, 5, 8],
    [3, 6, 9]
]
```

---

### Summary:
- `zip(*grid)` groups elements of each row into columns.
- The list comprehension converts the tuples into lists.
- The result is the transposed matrix.

---

### Full Example:
```python
grid = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

transposed_grid = [list(column) for column in zip(*grid)]

print(transposed_grid)
# Output:
# [
#     [1, 4, 7],
#     [2, 5, 8],
#     [3, 6, 9]
# ]
```
